What is the first step?

1) Continue to learn the math and python behind the project
2) BUT most importantly. I have to learn how to get data. 

I plan on using nba.com, basketball reference. I have to do something easy. I have to prove and show you in a Juypter file that the league has been shoowing 
more 3's and what rate they are shooting them.
