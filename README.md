# Shoulder-Injury-in-NBA
This is a short term passion project designed to help my learning of computer programming and other topics. It's to bring a lot of interests I have into one project. I will try my best to attempt to pull in influences of scientific article style thinking and writing using Juypter and data science. I would like to note that this is my first project like this and it will be very noobie. I invite all criticism and advise on my work as I am using github to develop my skill set. You can contact me at offiaccnt@outlook.com. Just know that this is a secondary email and I might not respond immediately.
